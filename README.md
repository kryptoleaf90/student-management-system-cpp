Hi! this is my very first project — a simple console-based Student Management System. I'm just getting started with programming and learning how to build useful tools step by step.
This project is a basic attempt to manage student records through a text-based interface. It’s not perfect yet, but I’m excited to keep improving it as I learn more.
Features so far:

- Add new student records
- Store student records dynamically using std::vector<Student>
- Display all student records
